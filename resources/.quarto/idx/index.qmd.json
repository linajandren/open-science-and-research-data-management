We recommend you to take notes from these reflections and bring them to group discussions arranged in connection to the course.\n\nThere will also be a final assignment that you should send in if you are a PhD student who want credits for this course. Even if you are not a PhD student getting credits, we encourage you to do these assignments as practicing and applying your knowledge will support your learning.\n\n## Learn more\nUnder this headline we will provide references and links to more material if you want to dive even deeper into the topic. \n\nAt the bottom, we inserted a progress bar so that you can see how far you have proceeded with the course material.\n\n\nMaterial for the course is in general subject to a CC-BY 4.0 Links to an external site. license and developed mainly by Lina Andrén, Rosa Lönneborg and Marianne Loor with help from co-workers and of course the persons who kindly agreed to be interviewed and consented to share their knowledge and experience throughout the course.
