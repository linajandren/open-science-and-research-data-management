It is not the same as free-ware, since open source components may be used as components in a commercial product and not exactly the same as [free-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) where the free-source movement has a more strict negative view on proprietary software. The term free and open-source software (FOSS) can be used as an umbrella term for software that is considered both free and open source.\n\nSource code is subjected by copyright where the creator(s) of the source code is the original copyright holder.

This makes it your choice to choose a license that is appropriate for the source code.\n\nWhile there is no recommendation for a specific license, it is recommended that you choose a license. If you provide no licensing information, it is very hard for someone else that wants to re-use your code to be sure whether that is allowed or not. There are a lot of different licenses to choose from and fortunately there are also guides that help you to choose a license that you think is appropriate, such as [choose a license.com](https://choosealicense.com/). If you want to use open source as a strategy to create impact, read more in the course on intellectual property and open source\n\nClick on the link above and take a few minutes to reflect on which license you would consider appropriate if you were to license any source code you had been writing on your own.

Is it compatible with the license you would like to choose?\n\nWhen it comes to reproducibility, it is important to document what software and what version of that software you are using. It quickly becomes very difficult to reproduce results from only data if this information is lacking. If possible, the source code for the software used for analysis should be documented in a public repository, and you can link to such repository in connection to sharing your data and results.\n\nConsiderations when working in a larger collaboration project\nWhen several people are involved in writing code in a collaborative project it is essential to use some kind of version control system (VCS, sometimes also referred to as source code management or revision control system)  to be able to keep track of changes done by different people that are contributing to the project. The most common VCS tool today is GIT although other VCS tools like CVS, SVN or Mercurial are also used. It is also useful to share a common code repository where you can commit different versions of the common source code generated, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) Links to an external site.. There are both private and public code repositories and for research projects in the Nordic countries the Nordic e-infrastructure for Computing (NEIC) offers a private [code repository for Nordic research code](https://source.coderefinery.org/users/sign_in). \n\nThe idea of open science is based on important principles in academic research on reproducibility and transparency. When working with industrial collaboration partners, open source, open data and Intellectual Property (IP) considerations may have to be balanced.
