  abstract = {This article reviews the debate within bibliometrics regarding the h-index. Despite its popularity as a decisionmaking tool within higher education, the h-index has become increasingly controversial among specialists. Fundamental questions remain regarding the extent to which the h-index actually measures what it sets out to measure. Unfortunately, many aspects of this debate are confined to highly technical discussions in specialised journals. This article explains in simple terms exactly why a growing number of bibliometricians are sceptical that the h-index is a useful tool for evaluating researchers. It concludes that librarians should be cautious in their recommendations regarding this metric, at least until better evidence becomes available.},

  abstract = {Working conditions of High-performance Marine Craft (HPMC) occupants are inherent with shock and vibration. Therefore, HPMC occupants are usually investigated believing that their psychophysical health and performance are negatively affected by exposure to these conditions. However, the association between the regular occupational vibration exposures of HPMC occupants and the deterioration of their health and performance is disputable. Therefore, a sample of HPMC occupants are investigated in a prospective cohort study by measuring perceived work exposure, health and performance via validated web-based questionnaires and physical work exposure as vibration using measurement systems installed onboard their craft. Incidence of musculoskeletal pain (MSP) during four operational seasons is determined and presented as incidence proportion (IP). Association between accumulated vibration exposure aboard HPMC and incidence of MSP is systematically assessed using multiple logistic regression models and expressed as odds ratio (OR). Moreover, the correlation between objectively and subjectively measured vibration exposures is determined using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rs). Incidence proportion of neck pain was 63.4\% and that of lower back pain ranged from 12.5\% to 87.5\% over the four seasons. The accumulated vibration exposure was strongly associated with the incidence of MSP primarily with lower back pain. However, the association was not statistically significant. The objective and subjective vibration exposures of the craft drivers showed a statistically significant positive monotonic correlation. The study suggests that occupational exposure to shock and vibration aboard HPMC is a factor increasing the incidence of MSP. The HPMC occupants regularly experience attrition in their performance. The perceived vibration exposure of the drivers can be used to rank the exposure severity aboard HPMC in the absence of objective measurements. The current vibration exposure assessment methods are also recommended to be revised accounting for shock and vibration inherent in HPMC exposures.},

  abstract = {High-Performance Marine Craft (HPMC) occupants are currently being investigated for various psychophysical impairments degrading work performance postulating that these deteriorations are related to their occupational exposures. However, scientific evidence for this is lacking and the association of exposure conditions aboard HPMC with adverse health and performance effects is unknown. Therefore, the study estimates the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain (MSP) among HPMC occupants and the association of their work exposure with MSP and performance degradation. It also presents a criterion for evaluating the self-reported exposure severity aboard three different types of mono-hull HPMC; displacement, semi-displacement and planing, on a par with the available standard criteria for objectively measurable exposures. Furthermore, another criterion is proposed to assess the performance-degradation of HPMC occupants based on self-reported fatigue symptoms and MSP. Swedish Coast Guard HPMC occupants were surveyed for MSP, fatigue symptoms as well as for work-related and individual risk indicators using a validated web-based questionnaire. Prevalence of MSP and performance-degradation during the past 12\,months were assessed and presented as a percentage of the sample. Associations of exposure conditions aboard HPMC with MSP and performance-capacity were systematically evaluated using multiple logistic regression models and expressed as odds ratio (OR). Prevalence of MSP was 72\% among which lower back pain was the most prevalent (46\%) followed by neck pain (29\%) and shoulder pain (23\%) while 29\% with degraded performance. Exposure to severe conditions aboard semi-displacement craft was associated with lower back (OR\,=\,2.3) and shoulder (OR\,=\,2.6) pain while severe conditions aboard planing craft with neck pain (OR\,=\,2.3) and performance-degradation (OR\,=\,2.6). MSP is common among Swedish coast guards. Severe exposure conditions aboard HPMC are significantly associated with both MSP and performance-degradation. The spine and shoulders are the most susceptible to work-related MSP among HPMC occupants which should be targeted in work-related preventive and corrective measures.},

The principles have to be considered as inspiring concepts but not strict rules. This means that they may lead to diverse interpretations and ambiguity. To remedy the proliferation of FAIRness measurements based on different interpretations of the principles, the RDA Working Group “FAIR data maturity model” established in January 2019 aims to develop a common set of core assessment criteria for FAIRness, as an RDA Recommendation. In the course of 2019 and the first half of 2020, the WG established a set of indicators and maturity levels for those indicators. As a result of the work, a first set of guidelines and a checklist related to the implementation of the indicators were produced, with the objective to further align the guidelines for evaluating FAIRness with the needs of the community.},

This research investigates how the OA Altmetrics Advantage holds for a specific case of research articles, namely the research outputs from universities in Finland. Furthermore, this research examines disciplinary and platform specific differences in that (dis)advantage. The new methodological approaches developed in this research focus on relative visibility, i.e. how often articles in OA journals receive at least one mention on the investigated online platforms, and relative receptivity, i.e. how frequently articles in OA journals gain mentions in comparison to articles in subscription-based journals. The results show significant disciplinary and platform specific differences in the OA advantage, with articles in OA journals within for instance veterinary sciences, social and economic geography and psychology receiving more citations and attention on social media platforms, while the opposite was found for articles in OA journals within medicine and health sciences. The results strongly support field- and platform-specific considerations when assessing the influence of journal OA status on altmetrics. The new methodological approaches used in this research will serve future comparative research into OA advantage of scientific articles over time and between countries.},

This review found (1) discoverability, sustainability, and remixing are significant barriers that stand in the way of OER disrupting traditional textbook models; (2) there is no significant difference in learning outcomes when instructors incorporate OER; and (3) implementation of OER as instructional strategies is challenging but can be effective in supporting positive learning outcomes when properly designed.

  abstract = {Objective High-performance marine craft personnel (HPMCP) are regularly exposed to vibration and repeated shock (VRS) levels exceeding maximum limitations stated by international legislation. Whereas such exposure reportedly is detrimental to health and performance, the epidemiological data necessary to link these adverse effects causally to VRS are not available in the scientific literature, and no suitable tools for acquiring such data exist. This study therefore constructed a questionnaire for longitudinal investigations in HPMCP. Methods A consensus panel defined content domains, identified relevant items and outlined a questionnaire. The relevance and simplicity of the questionnaire’s content were then systematically assessed by expert raters in three consecutive stages, each followed by revisions. An item-level content validity index (I-CVI) was computed as the proportion of experts rating an item as relevant and simple, and a scale-level content validity index (S-CVI/Ave) as the average I-CVI across items. The thresholds for acceptable content validity were 0.78 and 0.90, respectively. Finally, a dynamic web version of the questionnaire was constructed and pilot tested over a 1-month period during a marine exercise in a study population sample of eight subjects, while accelerometers simultaneously quantified VRS exposure. Results Content domains were defined as work exposure, musculoskeletal pain and human performance, and items were selected to reflect these constructs. Ratings from nine experts yielded S-CVI/Ave of 0.97 and 1.00 for relevance and simplicity, respectively, and the pilot test suggested that responses were sensitive to change in acceleration and that the questionnaire, following some adjustments, was feasible for its intended purpose. Conclusions A dynamic web-based questionnaire for longitudinal survey of key variables in HPMCP was constructed. Expert ratings supported that the questionnaire content is relevant, simple and sufficiently comprehensive, and the pilot test suggested that the questionnaire is feasible for longitudinal measurements in the study population.},

  abstract = {While science policy promotes data sharing and open data, these are not ends in themselves. Arguments for data sharing are to reproduce research, to make public assets available to the public, to leverage investments in research, and to advance research and innovation. To achieve these expected benefits of data sharing, data must actually be reused by others. Data sharing practices, especially motivations and incentives, have received far more study than has data reuse, perhaps because of the array of contested concepts on which reuse rests and the disparate contexts in which it occurs. Here we explicate concepts of data, sharing, and open data as a means to examine data reuse. We explore distinctions between use and reuse of data. Lastly we propose six research questions on data reuse worthy of pursuit by the community: How can uses of data be distinguished from reuses? When is reproducibility an essential goal? When is data integration an essential goal? What are the tradeoffs between collecting new data and reusing existing data? How do motivations for data collection influence the ability to reuse data? How do standards and formats for data release influence reuse opportunities? We conclude by summarizing the implications of these questions for science policy and for investments in data reuse.},

However, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the “citation benefit”. Furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. Method and Results. Here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors and investigate the variability of data reuse. In a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9\% (95\% confidence interval: 5\% to 13\%) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. Date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. The citation benefit varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation benefit was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30\%. Authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. To study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of GEO or ArrayExpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. Data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20\% of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. Conclusion. After accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. We conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. Other factors that may also contribute to the citation benefit are considered. We further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003.},

  abstract = {While rich medical, behavioral, and socio-demographic data are key to modern data-driven research, their collection and use raise legitimate privacy concerns. Anonymizing datasets through de-identification and sampling before sharing them has been the main tool used to address those concerns. We here propose a generative copula-based method that can accurately estimate the likelihood of a specific person to be correctly re-identified, even in a heavily incomplete dataset. On 210 populations, our method obtains AUC scores for predicting individual uniqueness ranging from 0.84 to 0.97, with low false-discovery rate. Using our model, we find that 99.98\% of Americans would be correctly re-identified in any dataset using 15 demographic attributes. Our results suggest that even heavily sampled anonymized datasets are unlikely to satisfy the modern standards for anonymization set forth by GDPR and seriously challenge the technical and legal adequacy of the de-identification release-and-forget model.},

  abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.}
